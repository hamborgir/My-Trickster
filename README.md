# My TrickStEr - Game Promotional Website UI ðŸŽ®

This project is a mock-up and interface design for a fictional game called **My TrickStEr**. It was created to fulfill a final project assignment, aiming to build a **responsive**, **user-friendly** website that promotes the game. The website features a modern and clean layout that adapts well across devices and screen sizes. Although not fully functional, it showcases the core design and layout of a game promotional website.

## Introduction

The **My TrickStEr** website is designed to capture the essence of the game with a focus on simplicity, ease of navigation, and a clean interface. The goal was to create a mock-up that would serve as a landing page for a promotional site, engaging visitors and providing information about the game. The project was built from scratch, starting with wireframes in **Figma** and then implemented using **HTML** and **CSS**. Although the JavaScript portion for interactivity was incomplete, the website stands as a strong demonstration of core **frontend development** principles.
